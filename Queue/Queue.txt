//Enque - adding elements O(1)
//Dequeue - to remove O(N)
//Deque - double ended queue 0(1)
//peek - check the top 0(N)
//ABOVE COMPLEXITIES IS USING ARRAY

//Queue using array
//size is fixed - so check if array is full, array is empty 
//F ->0 , R->INDX LAST ELE , initally it is in -1


In circular queue , it takes only O(1) time for enque, dequeue, peek.
